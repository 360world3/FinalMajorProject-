# Final Major Project 2017/2018

The Major Project is the primary portfolio work a student performs to showcase their talent for the world of employment. This is where you show the world what you can do – or even create the foundations of the startup company that you will build into a successful business after graduation. Students have the choice of either leading their own practical project OR producing a detailed business plan for a business start-up OR specializing in a particular skill area of Web Media.

# Project

### Final Major Project

There are several ways to approach your final major project.

**You can:**

* Create the foundations for a start-up for the future
* Produce a detailed business plan
* or create a product/project that sits within the web media skillset

**The two main choices are therefore:**

* Come up with a major Web Media project that you will lead, enlisting others from the course (and from outside the course if desired / necessary) as required. This can either be a detailed business plan, preferably with working prototype, or fully realised Web service.

* Choose a role (or roles) you would like to perform (interactive designer, CSS designer, Javascript coder, social media manager etc) and execute that role for other students’ major projects and / or external clients. In this case, you will need to work extensively on a negotiated number of other projects.

This brief will be negotiable, and live briefs – things you are working on in industry – could be permissible. But you have to pitch whatever you want to do to your Web Media tutors

Alongside the project itself, you will create a way of presenting your work visually, coherently and professionally in a well-designed format.

* The Report is an assessment tool and follows side-by-side the project work to construct an explanatory and visual representation of the processes behind your final projects.


# Learning Goals

* Ability to critically interrogate the societal, cultural, political and industrial factors relating to the project and reflect on the development of the work within these contexts.

* Ability to define a clear and concise summary of the problem, illustrate the evolution of ideas and articulate the proposed solution.

* A methodical approach to delivering a major piece of work, and the ability to critically include and exclude either content or intellectual ideas in order to achieve a project that has shape, form and focus.

* The ability to clearly articulate a concept or outline of a large piece of work in a compelling way that shows its aims, method, benefits or value to the readers or consumers, and expresses the context for the work.

* Knowledge of business start-up and freelance activities, which may include tax, finance and legal frameworks.

* Analysis of the subject discipline in relation to social values, innovation and business models within and beyond its industry field.


# Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts.
* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.
* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).
* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.
* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
