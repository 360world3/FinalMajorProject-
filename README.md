# Final Major Project 2017/2018

As its names suggests, this unit is all about collaboration. The web and photography industries often work together to make innovative campaigns and rebrands. The ability to work effectively in a team is vital for anyone wanting to make a career in either industry. This unit will not only test your ability to work with others, it will help to develop your ability to work with students from another course, in this case the Digital Photography course. To do that, you will have to understand the world of photography more deeply.


In particular, you will learn: 

* Art direction
* Rebranding 
* Working in teams 
* SEO 
* Advanced wordpress

# Learning Goals 

# Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts. We'll deduct 2% from your grade for each uncommunicated tardiness or absence (aka the *2% Tardiness Tax*).
* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.
* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).
* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.
* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
