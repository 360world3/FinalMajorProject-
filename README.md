# Final Major Project 2018/2019

The Major Project is the primary portfolio work a student performs to showcase their talent for the world of employment. This is where you show the world what you can do â€“ or even create the foundations of the startup company that you will build into a successful business after graduation.

# Project

### Final Major Project

There are several ways to approach your final major project.

**You can:**

* Producing a fully realised web based solution to a defined problem or opportunity with a strategy for marketing and monetization.
* Producing a detailed business plan for a business start-up that will be accompanied by a detailed prototype and marketing strategy.

**At the summative you are expected to deliver:**

* PART A: The Final Research Record Folder.
* PART B: The Branding Booklet.
* PART C: The Final Creative Output Delivery Folder.
* PART D: A 10-minute presentation.
* PART E: Your weekly blog posts from all 3 terms

# Learning Goals

* Ability to critically interrogate the societal, cultural, political and industrial factors relating to the project and reflect on the development of the work within these contexts.

* Ability to define a clear and concise summary of the problem, illustrate the evolution of ideas and articulate the proposed solution.

* A methodical approach to delivering a major piece of work, and the ability to critically include and exclude either content or intellectual ideas in order to achieve a project that has shape, form and focus.

* The ability to clearly articulate a concept or outline of a large piece of work in a compelling way that shows its aims, method, benefits or value to the readers or consumers, and expresses the context for the work.

* Knowledge of business start-up and freelance activities, which may include tax, finance and legal frameworks.

* Analysis of the subject discipline in relation to social values, innovation and business models within and beyond its industry field.


# Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts.
* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.
* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).
* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.
* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
