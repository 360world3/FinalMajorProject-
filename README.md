# Final Major Project 2017/2018

As its names suggests, this unit is all about collaboration. The web and photography industries often work together to make innovative campaigns and rebrands. The ability to work effectively in a team is vital for anyone wanting to make a career in either industry. This unit will not only test your ability to work with others, it will help to develop your ability to work with students from another course, in this case the Digital Photography course. To do that, you will have to understand the world of photography more deeply.


In particular, you will learn: 

* Art direction
* Rebranding 
* Working in teams 
* SEO 
* Advanced wordpress

# Project

### Final Major Project 

There are several ways to approach your final major project. 

**You can:**

* Create the foundations for a start-up for the future 
* Produce a detailed business plan 
* or create a product/project that sits within the web media skillet

**The two main choices are therefore:**

* Come up with a major Web Media project that you will lead, enlisting others from the course (and from outside the course if desired / necessary) as required. This can either be a detailed business plan, preferably with working prototype, or fully realised Web service.
* Choose a role (or roles) you would like to perform (interactive designer, CSS designer, Javascript coder, social media manager etc) and execute that role for other students’ major projects and / or external clients. In this case, you will need to work extensively on a negotiated number of other projects.

This brief will be negotiable, and live briefs – things you are working on in industry – could be permissible. But you have to pitch whatever you want to do to your Web Media tutors

Alongside the project itself, you will create a way of presenting your work visually, coherently and professionally in a well-designed format. 

* The Report is an assessment tool and follows side-by-side the project work to construct an explanatory and visual representation of the processes behind your final projects.


# Learning Goals 

# Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts. We'll deduct 2% from your grade for each uncommunicated tardiness or absence (aka the *2% Tardiness Tax*).
* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.
* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).
* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.
* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
