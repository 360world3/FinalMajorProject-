**Use min 15min individually and then talk to your peers about it.**

The first step in most project is discovery. This is the phase where you begin to map out the problem space and employ tools such as the five why's, how to frame your design challenge, problem definition and SWOT analysis amongst many more.

### Excersise 3 - Can you frame it as a design challenge? Or problem?

The design tools mentioned above can be found on [Disignkit](http://www.designkit.org/methods) and [DIY Tools](http://diytoolkit.org/tools/) website.

# Homework

Question to think about whilst watching and reading about the Lean Startup:

* How can this approach influence my work?
* When should you pivot?
* How is 'vanity metrics' distinctive from 'measurable metrics'?

Watch [this lecture by Eric Reis](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pFZmfqakuhE) on his methodology the Lean Start up
Here is a [slide deck that](http://www.lse.ac.uk/assets/richmedia/channels/publicLecturesAndEvents/slides/20120112_1830_theLeanStartup_sl.pdf) covers the same topic.

# Blog

### What is the lean startup and how can I use it as a methodology for my project?

Other questions to keep in mind:

* How can this approach influence my work?
* When should you pivot?
* How is 'vanity metrics' distinctive from 'measurable metrics'?
