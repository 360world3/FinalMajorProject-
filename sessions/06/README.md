### Hand-in package

Create a `WEB14303-Name-Surname.md` MarkDown document (where `Name` is your own name and `Surname` is your own surname, like `WEB14303-Tor-MNJamo.md`).

> You can edit MarkDown documents with the [Mou app](http://25.io/mou/) on OSX, the [MarkdownPad app](http://markdownpad.com/) on Windows, or online with [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) (all free).

In that MarkDown document, include the following:

- [ ] Link to your **formative presentation**   

	Preferably a Google Slides link.   

	If you use Keynote/Powerpoint export a PDF, upload it to Google Drive or SlideShare, and then grab the link to it.

- [ ] Research Record Folder
- [ ] Blog-posts
- [ ] Presentation


- [	] Images and texts to make your document more pleasant to read (see an example of an excellent `COURSECODE-Name-Surname.md` [here](https://github.com/TomSharmanWeb/HarrySeatonWebsite/blob/master/README.md)).

#### Moodle link

> Make sure all the folders, pages, documents & presentations you linked in your `WEB14303-Name-Surname.md` are publicly accessible (not just private to you)!
